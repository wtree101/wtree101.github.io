My name is Tong Wu, a Chinese student. I am currently studying mathematics and applied
mathematics at Sun Yat-sen University and expected to graduate in 2022.6. I have a strong interest
in information science and computational mathematics, especially in digital signal and image
processing, and their applications in medicine and brain science. I hope to study for a Ph.D. in this
field and make meaningful contributions both in theory and application.
